      <h2>DFA UC San Diego.</h2>

      <p>Done through Design for America's UC San Diego studio and Latinas Contra Cancer,
        a San Jose based nonprofit raising cancer awareness in Latinx communities, the goal
        was to research and design improvements for LCC's series of virtual health education workshops,
        which had moved to a virtual environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
      </p>

      <p>As a result of their shift to digital workshops, Latinas Contra Cancer self-reported
        a decline in attendance, interactivity, and intimacy necessitated by their primary cancer
        education objectives. To this end, we approached this project from an end-to-end perspective
        encompassing mailing list communication, community engagement, and gamified incentivization
        amongst other elements contained within our final output.

      <h2>Research & Discovery</h2>

      <p>The research for this project was originally heavily based on the user needs of
      both LCC as a host as well as the workshop's communal participants. However, conflicting
      schedules and miscommunication limited our team's ability to perform comprehensive user
      interviews and tasks. We turned to a wide scope of competitive analysis, user observation,
      and rapid prototyping in response.</p>

      <p>The limited information that arose out of this situation widened the scope of our
      potential solutions. In a short pre-project briefing, LCC listed several of their key
      responsiblities in addition to a concept of their desired deliverable: a template/itinerary
      for each workshop session. This raised a question of expertise; we did not feel as if our team
      was collectively informed at a level where we could feel confident to make sweeping changes
      to the core content of each workshop, given the intimacy of the subject and community.</p>

      <p>We finalized our user research & discovery phase with a shift towards a more holistic approach
      that addressed interactions before, during, and after the virtual workshop within the context
      of LCC's initial deliverable concept. By taking this more expansive approach, we were able
      to generate more focused and concise areas of improvement while giving LCC the autonomy to
      approach their specific curriculum as they saw fit.</p>

      <h2>Ideation & Exploration</h2>

      <p>To build a greater sense of community and to enable LCC to better tailor their workshops
      to the participants' needs, we overhauled the pre-workshop sign-up/registration system by expanding
      the previous Google Forms to include an opt-in mailing list and space for any personal questions.
      These additions reduce the barriers of technological know-how through asynchronous information delivery
      and provides LCC the opportunity to  present their information in more optimal ways if there are
      prevailing pre-workshop questions.</p>

      <p>Within the workshop content itself, in order to improve interactivity we turned to a number
      of tools used to quiz and ask questions to the participants. Instead of having users manually
      "raise their hand" by typing the letter A into the chat first, we suggested moving quiz questions
      to either the upcoming Kahoot collaboration features or built-in Zoom polls. This reduced the
      cognitive load required to answer questions that were already incentivized through a gift card
      giveaway. We also introduced asynchronous interactions through a number of self-care bingo cards
      designed to promote healthy habits and awareness.</p>

      <p>Following the workshop, we closed the loop of the sign-up form with a continued mailing list
      and opportunity for participants to offer feedback following the workshop. The nature of LCC's
      cancer education mission within their community demands an intimacy and understanding that
      is better maintained through consistent feedback and dialogue, and LCC will be better able to
      send out information about important upcoming events and resources.</p>

      <h2>Implementation</h2>

      <p>To create the final pdf deliverable I took charge in establishing a modular grid adaptable
      to the variety of information, text, and visual elements used to convey our series of workshop items.
      Emphasizing modernity and friendliness, I opted for a humanist sans-serif typeface and colorful
      illustration to avoid any type of robotic, authoritative tones.

      <h2>Takeaways</h2>

      <p>Designing dynamically and making important leap-of-faith assumptions is an inevitability,
      short of having perfect user research and infinite time. Our wonderful industry mentors from
      Intuit helped to establish informed constraints and precise direction within the problem space, which
      enabled us to better iterate on the core structures of our design. The process can begin
      with a wild, idealistic exploration of ideas but also demands a fine attention to detail even within
      the more mundane spaces.</p>
